"""
Persistent HTTP proxy that owns ONE Telethon userbot session and exposes the
upstream chigwell/telegram-mcp tools over MCP streamable-HTTP for the iva agent.

Why this exists (hard-won lesson, do not "simplify" away):
- Exactly ONE process may own a given Telethon session. A second opener desyncs
  the MTProto session and crashes Telethon with TypeNotFoundError. So this proxy
  is the sole session owner; iva reaches it on demand over HTTP.

Design:
- Session-less boot. If no saved session exists yet, we seed an EMPTY StringSession
  so upstream's `_discover_accounts()` builds an unauthorized-but-connectable client
  instead of `sys.exit(1)`. The QR-login tools (Phase 1, onboarding.py) authorize
  that SAME live client in place, then persist the real session — no restart, no
  hot-swap of a different client.
- Bearer auth + bind 127.0.0.1 (single box; defense-in-depth on top of localhost).
- receive_updates defaults to True upstream, so Telethon's own loop auto-reconnects;
  we add a cheap EnsureConnected middleware as belt-and-suspenders.

Env:
  TELEGRAM_MCP_HOST   bind address        (default 127.0.0.1)
  TELEGRAM_MCP_PORT   bind port           (default 8724)
  TELEGRAM_MCP_TOKEN  bearer secret; every request must send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  TELEGRAM_API_ID / TELEGRAM_API_HASH     from my.telegram.org (required)
  TELEGRAM_SESSION_FILE  path to the SQLite session file. Default: <iva_root>/data/
                         telegram-userbot.session, beside the proxy token. The production
                         unit passes ASSISTANT_DATA_DIR as one canonical absolute path.
