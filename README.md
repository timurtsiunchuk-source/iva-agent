---

Iva is a self-hosted Telegram AI assistant with layered memory that turns your messages into an Obsidian-compatible vault. You talk, it files: voice notes, photos, forwarded posts and decisions become plain-markdown cards it actually remembers. Everything runs on your own server, with your keys and your data.

**One command installs it:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva-agent/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Why people run Iva

- "What did we agree with client X about the last shipment?" — found in seconds, months later.
- A five-minute voice note from the car → a task list, a draft email, a meeting card.
- "Make a quote from this price list, cut the discount by 2.5%, send it to the client" — a finished Google Doc, link in the chat.

The rest — for business owners, specialists, executives and everyday life: **[Use cases](docs/use-cases.md)**.

## How it works

<img src="assets/iva-flow.webp" alt="How Iva works: voice, text, photos and PDFs fly from Telegram into the willow-tree agent, wired to memory, nightly rollup, cron, reminders, search, web, workspace and docs" width="100%">

The bridge long-polls Telegram, so no public HTTPS, domain or webhook is needed. Iva runs as two systemd user services, two systemd watchdog timers and seven in-process eve schedules — operations live in [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md).

**Wondering what you'd actually use an agent for?** → [25+ real scenarios — business, work, everyday life](docs/use-cases.md).

## Features

<details>
<summary><b>Voice, vision, memory, personal CRM, Google Workspace, skills — expand the full list</b></summary>

- **Voice** — voice, audio and video notes transcribed with Deepgram nova-3; auto-detects ru/uz/en.
- **Vision** — photos described by your provider's own vision model; no extra key, no extra bill.
- **Rich replies** — tables, checklists, collapsible blocks and formulas render natively in Telegram via Bot API 10.1 rich messages; plain formatting keeps its proven path, with a graceful fallback.
- **Quiet update checks** — once a day Iva checks for a newer stable release without spending model tokens. If one exists, Telegram offers **Update** or **Later** once; otherwise it says nothing.
- **Layered memory** — remembers across months, long after the chat window has scrolled away.
- **Personal CRM** — who your people are, what you agreed, when to follow up.
- **Search by meaning** — BM25 plus link-graph rerank, any language; optional vector mode with one key.
- **Decision cards** — what you chose, when and why; old versions stay in a dated History.
- **[Tasks](docs/tasks.md) & reminders** — priorities, due dates and a daily brief.
- **Web search** — four pluggable providers: Tavily, Exa, Parallel or Brave.
- **Google Workspace** — Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs and Tasks from chat via the `gws` CLI; installed for you, with a guided key setup right in the conversation.
- **Skills & MCP** — drop one file to add a procedure or connect an MCP server; keys stay in `.env`.
- **Personal Telegram — userbot** — read and send from your _own_ account, not just the bot; connect by chat (QR, no terminal). Opt-in, **at your own risk**. A server-side anti-ban guardrail (FloodWait compliance + randomized pacing + circuit-breaker) is enforced, not just advised. [Details](docs/userbot.md).
- **Safe to forward** — forwarded text, captions and voice transcripts pass an injection screen before the model reads them. A flagged message or transcript reaches the model tagged as data rather than as an instruction; for media captions the screen runs but the tag does not travel with it yet.
- **Token accounting** — every model step is logged; `/usage` reports it for free.

## The Memory Tree

<img src="assets/iva-memory-tree.webp" alt="How Iva remembers: a leaf is a day, branches are weeks and months, tree rings are years around CORE.md" width="100%">

| Layer       | What lives there                                                                                    | Path                                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 🍃 Leaves   | the word-for-word transcript of each day, Iva's replies included                                    | `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`                                |
| 🌿 Branches | summaries folded upward: day → week → month → year                                                  | `summaries/daily/`, `weekly/`, `monthly/`, `yearly/` |
| 🪵 Trunk    | `CORE.md` (≤1200 chars, in every prompt) + typed cards: contacts, projects, decisions, ideas, notes | `CORE.md`, `cards/`                                  |

- Every message lands verbatim in a daily markdown log — nothing is paraphrased on arrival.
- A nightly rollup at 04:00 distills day → week → month → year into schema-validated cards; facts that change get rewritten, not piled up.
- One core file, `CORE.md` (≤1,200 chars), rides in every prompt — Iva knows you before it searches anything.

Full architecture and search internals: [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).

## A secretary inside Telegram

<img src="assets/iva-userbot.webp" alt="Your secretary inside Telegram: the userbot reads group chats from your own account, collects summaries and replies as you, guarded by a server-enforced anti-ban guardrail" width="100%">

The bot is half of Telegram. The other half is your personal account: connect the userbot (opt-in) and Iva works from it like a secretary — reads the group chats you never keep up with, folds them into summaries, catches the messages that actually need you, and replies as you.

- **All of Telegram** — groups, channels, unreads, search and the full history of your personal account.
- **Onboarding in chat** — tell the bot to connect your Telegram, scan a QR. No terminal.
- **Anti-ban guardrail on the server** — FloodWait compliance, a randomized delay after every send, and a circuit-breaker that pauses sending after three FloodWaits in 24 hours. It is enforced in the proxy rather than asked for in a prompt, and it wraps the three outbound calls that actually get accounts flagged: messages, files, forwards. Joins, invites, contact imports and reactions are not wrapped — those limits live in the skill file, which is a prompt.
- **Read-only mode** — one `.env` switch and Iva can read and search but physically cannot send.

> [!WARNING]
> Automating a personal account is against Telegram's ToS and can get the account limited or banned. The userbot is opt-in and used at your own risk — reading is far safer than sending. Details: [docs/userbot.md](docs/userbot.md).

## Security & privacy

<img src="assets/iva-security-gate.webp" alt="Untrusted input from Telegram and the web passes the security gate: corrupted messages drop into the reject tray, only clean context reaches the vault" width="100%">

Web pages, search results, voice transcripts, captions and the vision model's description of a picture reach the model only through a prompt-injection sanitizer. On a forwarded text message the same gate annotates the turn with a warning instead of filtering the text, and document bodies, userbot-read chats and `agent-browser` output are not screened at all. Everything that leaves through the Outbox passes a secret-redaction gate, and the user allowlist fails closed — an empty list answers nobody. Your memory is a private git repo you own; the honest boundary is that the model and transcription are cloud APIs you choose and pay for. Gate internals and the full boundary: [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## Install

One command on any Ubuntu/Debian box — a fresh VPS or your own machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva-agent/main/install.sh | bash
```

1. Get a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Run the installer and answer its questions.
3. Message your bot. The wizard picks your Telegram ID out of that message, finishes setup, and Iva confirms right in the chat that it's live.

Brand-new VPS, still logged in as root? Run `bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva-agent/main/bootstrap.sh)` first: it creates your sudo user (with lingering enabled), updates the box, and turns on a firewall, fail2ban and SSH hardening. It asks three things — a login, its password, and the timezone — and no SSH key. Then log in as that user with that password and run the installer above. Details: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

Install as a normal user, not as root — Iva's shell tool runs as whoever installed it. Headless installs take `--skip-setup` or `--non-interactive`. Prefer to read before you run? Fetch it with `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva-agent/main/install.sh -o install.sh`, read it, then `bash install.sh`. Wizard walkthrough and an SSH primer for first-time VPS owners: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

### Updates

- `iva update` installs releases only (`vX.Y.Z` tags) — the default.
- `main` holds releases only; every accepted change lands in the `beta` branch first.
- `iva beta` turns on beta updates: the tip of the `beta` branch; `iva stable` turns them off and goes back to `main` (nothing is rolled back — the next release catches up). Then run `iva update`.
- Any installation, 0.4.8 included, switches to beta with one command: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva-agent/beta/beta.sh | bash`. A new installation on beta: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smixs/iva-agent/beta/install.sh | IVA_BETA=1 bash`.
- The same switch is in Telegram: `/menu` → 🛠 Maintenance → 🧪 Updates. `iva version` shows which one is on.

### The first minute

Three messages, and you can watch the memory work:

1. Send a voice note about your day — anything, out loud. Then look in `daily/` inside your vault on the server: your words are sitting there in plain markdown, dated, yours. No other assistant hands you the file.
2. Tell it something a colleague would remember: `Marina at Acme wants the revised quote by Friday — she never picks up the phone.`
3. Ask for it back the way a person would: `how should I follow up with Marina?` — the answer comes from the card Iva just wrote, not from the last few messages.

Then send a photo of a business card, or forward a long post and ask for the gist. `/menu` has the rest; the full list is in [25+ scenarios](docs/use-cases.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Install from a clone — build it yourself</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smixs/iva-agent.git ~/iva
cd ~/iva && bash install.sh
```

The installer reuses the existing checkout instead of re-cloning, keeps `.env` and the vault untouched, and installs the same dependencies. A fork or a branch works through variables read at startup: `REPO_URL=…`, `BRANCH=…`, `INSTALL_DIR=…` (defaults: this repo, `main`, `~/iva`). Details: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Providers & cost

Six model providers. Pick one and fill its block in `.env`:

| Provider         | How you pay                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| OpenCode Go      | API key, ~$10/mo ($5 first month)      |
| Ollama Cloud     | API key, ~$20/mo                       |
| OpenRouter       | API key, pay-as-you-go, 300+ models    |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT) | your Plus/Pro subscription, no API key |
| Claude (Pro/Max) | your Pro/Max subscription, no API key  |
| Custom           | your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint    |

Default model is deepseek-v4-pro, 131k context. On Go it runs about $14–15/mo all-in ($10 model + $4–5 VPS; the model's first month is $5), no markup; voice rides Deepgram's free starter credit. Model lists, limits and the search matrix: [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).

## eve sources

Iva carries eve 0.51.1 sources from vercel/eve in `eve/`, with our changes under Apache-2.0 and the original NOTICE. Maintainers build the package once; installations fetch the pinned archive. See [building and publishing eve](docs/eve.md).

## What's New

<details>
<summary><b>v0.5.0 · 15.10.2026 — expand the latest releases</b></summary>

### 15.10.2026

#### v0.5.0

- 💬 **Replies appear as they are written, ■ stops the turn**: in private chats, Iva shows a draft and the current tool. The final answer arrives as a separate message.
- 🎯 **Goal follows through to the result**: a helper checks for a reply or change on a schedule and keeps a plan within the boundaries you set. Iva brings the result or a question; you close the goal.
- 🤝 **A helper takes long work into the background**: Iva hands it an assignment and keeps talking with you. She reports the outcome in the main chat; you can stop the helper in words.
- 🛠 **eve is built from Iva's sources**: installation and updates download the ready archive `eve-0.51.1-iva.3` with Iva's changes.
- 🔎 **Iva prepares the next step for your tasks**: Watch, Brief and Insight check current goals and prior declines. Iva cites the source and why she is writing now, then prepares a reply draft or checked next steps.
- 🛡 **Secrets stay on the server**: before sending a file, Iva checks its contents, including binary files. Replies hide keys and tokens by value, even without a label.
- 🔘 **Button questions handle slow sending**: choices survive delays, and tapping an old button again stays a duplicate. Links with special characters open in full, topic service events stay silent, and deleted tasks keep their identifiers.
- 🔧 **DeepSeek continues after a tool call**: in thinking mode on Ollama Cloud and OpenCode Go, the model receives its reasoning along with the tool result.
- 🌙 **Night preserves direct memory edits**: a conflict in one day lets the other days and the report finish. The updater preserves another process's lock and installs verified Google CLI; closed turns stay closed after a restart.
- 🔧 **Iva retries the request up to three times after an empty response**: retries stay within the same step; previously Iva retried once.

### 11.10.2026

#### v0.4.17

- 🐚 **Iva runs server commands in bash**: they used to go through the minimal `/bin/sh` shell, and on Ubuntu and Debian ordinary bash syntax failed with «Syntax error». Iva corrected herself, but lost a step and logged a failure. Now such commands pass the first time.
- 🛡 **Iva refuses harmless commands less often**: search and print commands (grep, echo, head, cut, wc, ls, getent) were refused when quoted text held words like «batch» or «at». Now they pass, and so does `iva … --help`. Restarting Iva and schedules that bypass reminders are blocked as before. Command chains with sed, heredoc text and git commit messages may still be refused (#287).
- 📓 **A helper's draft no longer lands in the daily note**: when Iva handed part of the work to a helper, its raw answer was written to the daily note as her reply, though you never received it. Now the daily note holds only what Iva wrote to you.

#### v0.4.16

- 📨 **Messages sent while Iva is busy reach her together**: if you send several messages or files while she is answering, Iva gets them at once and answers once instead of replying to each in turn. Commands, replies to her messages and button taps still go separately. In «Interrupt» mode a new message waits until Iva has picked up the ones already collected.
- 💬 **During long work you can see what Iva is busy with**: a private chat shows a streaming draft with the current tool. The native ■ control stops the turn. Groups and topics show typing and use `/stop`. The final answer arrives as a separate reply.
- 🔎 **Iva searches on her own first, then asks**: before asking you a question, she checks her memory, chats and mail, the web and the server, and in the question she says what she has already checked. What to choose and whether something may be done she still asks you.
- 📄 **Replacements in Word files no longer double up**: in a merged table cell, replacing «100» with «1000» gave «10000». Now each replacement is made once, and page breaks, tabs and pictures next to the text stay in place.

### 10.10.2026

#### v0.4.15

- 🔧 **The userbot comes back after an update**: after `iva update` the userbot could keep restarting in a loop and never work. Now Iva prepares it before it starts and waits until it answers. If it cannot be prepared, the userbot is switched off, and Iva tells you in Telegram what stops working and where to turn it back on (`/menu`, 📡 Userbot screen, «Turn on»). `iva restart` leaves a working userbot as it is.
- 🛠 **Telegram search through the userbot no longer trips up**: sometimes Iva named an account that does not exist or wrote «null» where nothing had to be given, and the request to the userbot failed. Now such a request goes to your connected account, and a chat can be given as a `t.me/name` link. Thanks to @Entset for the fix.
- 🎙 **Iva spells names in voice notes the way you set them**: in `/menu`, on the «🎤 Voice» screen, tap «Names and terms» and list names and words separated by commas, for example OJ, Sonnet, Todoist. Voice transcripts will spell them the same way in every message. For now only words in Latin letters work; Iva shortens a list that is too long to what Deepgram accepts at once and tells you so. Deepgram charges a small extra per minute for this feature; without a list everything works as before.
- ⏳ **When the model stays silent, Iva suggests /new**: if the model again and again does not start answering in the same conversation, Iva suggests sending `/new`. A long conversation may have become too heavy for the model, and `/new` starts a fresh one.

Full history — [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Built on

[eve](https://eve.dev/docs/introduction) 0.51.1-iva.3, Vercel's agent framework, runs the agent; Node 24's built-in SQLite runs the search index — no separate database. Iva grew out of [agent-second-brain](https://github.com/smixs/agent-second-brain) and [autograph](https://github.com/smixs/autograph) — that story is in [docs/memory.md](docs/memory.md).

## Thanks

Iva gets better because people run it for real — contributors are welcome. [Open an issue](https://github.com/smixs/iva-agent/issues) with what breaks, or send a PR. Everyone who already helped: [docs/thanks.md](docs/thanks.md).

## License

[MIT](LICENSE) — take it, change it, run it on a hundred servers; just don't blame anyone if something breaks.
