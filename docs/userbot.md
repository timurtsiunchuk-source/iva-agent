![Your secretary inside Telegram: the userbot reads group chats from your own account, collects summaries and replies as you, with a server-enforced anti-ban guardrail](../assets/iva-userbot.webp)

Iva can read and send from your **personal Telegram account** (a userbot), not just
the bot. It talks to a small proxy — `services/telegram-userbot/serve.py` — that owns
one Telethon session and exposes Telegram over MCP on `127.0.0.1`. Iva connects to it
natively (`agent/connections/telegram-userbot.ts`).

> ⚠️ **Account-ban risk.** Automating a personal account violates Telegram's ToS and can
> get the account **banned** — especially for sending. Reading is far safer.
>
> A **built-in anti-ban guardrail is enforced server-side** (`guardrails.py`) — not just
> advice: FloodWait compliance (wait ×1.3, retry once), a randomized delay after every send
> (fixed-interval bots get flagged), and a circuit-breaker that pauses sending after 3
> FloodWaits in 24h. It wraps `send_message`, `send_file` and `forward_messages` — the agent
> cannot talk past those. Raw-API writes (joins, invites, contact imports, reactions) are not
> wrapped: their limits live in the skill file, which is a prompt, so treat them as advisory.
> Limits are still per-account, so behave like a human. Full rules: `agent/skills/telegram-userbot/safety.md`.

## Connect — just chat with the bot

You never touch a terminal. Tell the bot **«подключи мой телеграм»** and it does everything
for you, in chat:

1. It warns you (at your own risk) and, the first time, walks you through creating an app at
   <https://my.telegram.org> → **API development tools** — you paste the `api_id` / `api_hash`
   back into the chat. The agent provisions the proxy for you (builds its venv, starts the
   service) via its host shell — no restart of iva needed.
2. It renders a QR and sends it as an image into your chat. Scan it in the Telegram app of the
   account you're connecting: **Settings → Devices → Link Desktop Device**.
3. If you have 2FA, it asks for your password (change it afterward if you'd rather it not pass
   through chat). Done — the session persists on the server, so this is one-time.

> [!WARNING]
> Whatever you type in the chat is stored verbatim in that day's `daily/` log, `api_hash` and
> 2FA password included, and it passes through the model like any other message. After
> connecting, delete those lines from the daily file — and if you sent a 2FA password, change
> it. There is no separate secure channel for this yet.

## Manual commands (optional — the agent runs these for you)

```bash
iva userbot creds    # read api_id + api_hash from stdin → .env (two lines)
iva userbot setup    # build venv, generate the token, enable + start the proxy (idempotent)
iva userbot status   # shared service, proxy and Telegram-login health
iva userbot diagnose --json  # read-only machine-readable health
iva userbot off      # stop and disable the proxy
```

The health state is one of `off`, `starting`, `unreachable`, `unauthorized` or
`ready`. CLI and Telegram use the same 1.5-second probe. It checks the existing
proxy's `/healthz` route, which reads authorization from the proxy's one live
Telethon client and never opens another session. Diagnostics expose only fixed
state/reason values; bearer tokens and transport errors are not returned.

For tool parameter errors, Iva's [userbot skill](../agent/skills/telegram-userbot/SKILL.md)
instructs it to omit unused optional fields, use actual account labels from `list_accounts`
when a label is needed, and pass JSON booleans rather than strings. It repairs the named
field instead of repeating the same failing call. A generic `GEN-ERR-328` response does
not identify the cause; account discovery and health diagnostics help narrow it down,
but the skill cannot restore error details hidden by the upstream Telegram MCP server.

## Safety knobs

- `TELEGRAM_EXPOSED_TOOLS=read-only` in `.env` — the agent can read/search but physically
  cannot send or mutate (the proxy prunes all write tools). Onboarding still works.
- `TELEGRAM_MCP_PORT` (default `8724`), `TELEGRAM_USERBOT_QR_CHAT_ID` (defaults to the first
  of `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`). The default needs no config. If you set a custom port,
  run `iva userbot setup` (restarts the proxy) **and** `iva restart` (iva reads the port from
  its env at start) so both agree.
- The proxy bearer lives in `data/telegram-userbot.token` (0600), read at runtime by both the
  proxy and iva — so the agent can provision the proxy mid-chat without restarting iva.

## How it works

- **One session owner.** Exactly one process may own a Telethon session; a second opener
  desyncs MTProto. The proxy is that owner; iva calls it over HTTP.
- **Session-less boot.** With no session yet, the proxy comes up unauthorized (onboarding
  mode) and serves only login tools until you scan the QR — then the same live client
  becomes authorized in place, no restart.
- **Enforced anti-ban.** `guardrails.py` wraps the outbound methods (`send_message`,
  `send_file`, `forward_messages`) with FloodWait compliance, randomized pacing, and a
  circuit-breaker (3 FloodWaits in 24h → sending pauses).
- Built on [chigwell/telegram-mcp](https://github.com/chigwell/telegram-mcp) `v3.2.0`
  (116 tools), pinned in `services/telegram-userbot/requirements.txt`.
