# Providers & cost

Iva runs on your server with your keys. Here is every external service it talks to, with real prices: one paid model subscription, one paid box — everything else fits a free tier. Total: about $9/mo. A subscription you already pay for (ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Claude Pro/Max) works too — then the model line costs nothing extra.

## Model providers

| Provider                          | Price                        | Text models                                                                                                                                      | Vision                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **OpenCode Go** (ex-Zen)          | ~$5/mo                       | ~23 models fetched live at setup — `deepseek-v4-pro` (default), `kimi-k3`, `kimi-k2.7-code`, `glm-5.2`, `minimax-m3`, `qwen3.7-max`, `grok-4.5`… | `qwen3.7-plus`, override with `OPENCODE_VISION_MODEL`              |
| **Ollama Cloud**                  | ~$20/mo                      | ~19 models fetched live — `deepseek-v4-pro` (default), `kimi-k3`, `glm-5.2`, `minimax-m3`, `gpt-oss:120b`…                                       | `gemma4:31b`, override with `OLLAMA_VISION_MODEL`                  |
| **OpenRouter**                    | pay-as-you-go                | 300+ models across vendors — pick any slug (`vendor/model`)                                                                                      | `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, override with `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` |
| **OpenAI (ChatGPT subscription)** | your existing Plus/Pro/Team  | the models your plan exposes (`gpt-6.1-sol`, `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`, `gpt-5.x`), fetched live                                                 | same subscription (multimodal), no variable                        |
| **Claude (Pro/Max subscription)** | your existing Pro/Max plan   | Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-fable-5-1`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`), the ones the plan's picker has                     | same subscription (multimodal), no variable                        |
| **Custom (OpenAI-compatible)**    | whatever your endpoint costs | whatever your endpoint serves — the wizard reads `GET {base}/models` when there is one, otherwise you type the id                                | the chat model itself, or a slug in `CUSTOM_VISION_MODEL`          |

The first three are plain API keys, `codex` and `claude` ride subscriptions you already pay for, and `custom` is an address you supply:

- 🔌 **OpenAI-compatible** — Go, Ollama and OpenRouter share the same wire format, so switching is one line in `.env`
- 🌍 **Any IP** — all answer from any server location, no region blocks
- 💸 **No markup** — you pay the provider directly; Iva adds nothing on top

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=opencode   # or ollama / openrouter / codex / claude / custom, then `iva restart`
```

Those six names, spelled exactly. Anything else — `ollmaa`, `OLLAMA` — stops the agent at startup with the list of accepted names, instead of running Ollama under a name nobody configured ([troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)).

OpenCode Go only serves clients that identify themselves: every request carries Iva's own `User-Agent` (`iva/<version>`) and a stable conversation id in `x-opencode-session` — the eve session id, or one id per process where there is no session (planner, vision). Without them Go answers `MissingSessionID` on every turn ([Go docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/go/#where-can-i-use-it)). Other providers get neither header.

Start with Go: a quarter of the price, ~23 models to switch between (the wizard pulls the live list, so new ones like `kimi-k3` appear on their own). Keys, model pick and context-window settings live in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

Two things about the live lists. Both catalogs churn — Ollama Cloud retired `gemma3:12b` on 2026-07-15 and Go dropped `gemini-3-flash`, so a hand-written model id in `.env` can start failing without you touching anything; if the bot goes quiet after weeks of silence on your side, re-run `iva config` and re-pick from the live list. And on Ollama Cloud the frontier tags (`kimi-k3` among them) bill as **extra usage** on top of the plan: with an empty extra-usage balance the API answers `402`, so top it up at [ollama.com/settings](https://ollama.com/settings) or stay on `deepseek-v4-pro`.

### OpenCode Go protocols (`opencode`)

Go's catalog includes models served over different endpoints. Select the wire explicitly from [Go's endpoint table](https://opencode.ai/docs/go/#endpoints), without changing provider or adding a key:

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=opencode
OPENCODE_MODEL=muse-spark-1.3-contributor
OPENCODE_PROTOCOL=responses
iva restart
```

`chat-completions` remains the default. Responses models include Muse Spark, Grok 4.6/4.7 and GPT 5.6/6 Luna. `iva config` asks for the protocol and probes Responses with tools before saving; `/model` retains the selected protocol and validates Responses selections over that wire. Session headers, usage and night use the same factory. Thinking levels are unavailable for Go Responses until its reasoning contract is verified.

Vision falls back through its own `OPENCODE_VISION_PROTOCOL` (also `chat-completions` by default); set it to `responses` for a compatible image-capable Responses model. The selected text model is tested for image understanding over its actual wire first. Go `/messages` models are unsupported, including the current documented endpoint for the old `qwen3.7-plus` vision default. Choose a compatible fallback instead; Iva reports a protocol refusal and continues without a fabricated image description. Existing installs retain their previous defaults.

### OpenAI by ChatGPT subscription (`codex`)

Use the OpenAI subscription you already pay for — no separate API key, no per-token bill. Iva signs in the same way the official `codex` CLI does (OAuth against `auth.openai.com`), stores a refreshable token in `data/codex-auth.json` (chmod 600), and calls the subscription's Responses backend directly. The access token is refreshed automatically before it expires. If the backend rejects a still-fresh token after the subscription lapses, Iva forces one refresh and retries once; a second rejection tells you to run `iva login`.

```bash
iva login              # device code: opens a link + one-time code (works on a headless VPS)
iva login --browser    # PKCE flow: opens a browser on this machine
iva config             # pick the provider (option 3) and a model from your plan's live list
iva restart
```

Notes: the model list is pulled from your subscription at setup time, so you always see exactly what your plan allows. Set `CODEX_CONTEXT_WINDOW` to the real window of the model you picked (compaction derives its threshold from it). Routing a self-hosted assistant through the ChatGPT subscription backend is a grey area under OpenAI's terms — you are using your own subscription on your own server, but weigh that yourself.

### Claude by Pro/Max subscription (`claude`)

Use the Claude subscription you already pay for — no API key, no per-token bill, nothing to paste into `.env`. Iva calls the `claude` CLI (Claude Code) installed and signed in on the same server, so the CLI's own login is what pays for the requests.

```bash
npm install -g --prefix ~/.local @anthropic-ai/claude-code   # as the service user, no root: lands in ~/.local/bin
claude auth login      # one sign-in on the server (a link + code)
iva config             # pick the provider (option 4) and a model from the subscription's live list
iva restart
```

Notes: the screen offers three models — Fable 5.1, Opus 5.5 and Sonnet 5.5 — and only those the CLI picker actually has. `.env` stores the canonical id (`claude-fable-5-1`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`), never a picker alias. `claude auth status` names the plan, and `iva doctor` prints it next to the model. Requests are billed by the CLI — they count as `claude -p` (Agent SDK) usage on your plan. `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_WINDOW` for these three is 1000000. The service's `PATH` is the node directory, then `~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/bin`; `iva doctor` looks for `claude` on that same `PATH`, not on your shell's. If the CLI lives elsewhere, point `CLAUDE_COMMAND` at the binary. `/model` → Claude checks the CLI and repeats the check after you sign in there.

### OpenRouter (`openrouter`)

One key for [300+ models](https://openrouter.ai/models) (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Meta…), billed pay-as-you-go. Too many to list, so setup takes the model **slug** from you:

1. Key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) (`sk-or-…`).
2. Copy a slug from [openrouter.ai/models](https://openrouter.ai/models) — the `vendor/model` id under the name (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5.5`). The model must support **tool/function calling**: Iva sends tools every turn, so chat-only or image models won't work.
3. `iva config` → provider `4` → paste the key, then the slug. Setup fires a live test **with a tool call** and continues only once the model answers — a mistyped slug or a no-tools model is rejected on the spot, not later as a silent bot.

Set `OPENROUTER_CONTEXT_WINDOW` to the model's real window. Vision runs through `google/gemini-2.5-flash` regardless of your text model (billed to your OpenRouter credit); `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` takes any other image-capable slug.

### Your own OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`custom`)

Anything that speaks OpenAI `chat/completions` and you can reach: your own proxy, a vendor plan sold as an OpenAI-compatible key, vLLM, LiteLLM, a llama.cpp server on the same box. Before this existed the only way in was patching the provider table, and every `iva update` threw the patch away — now it is four lines of `.env` and nothing in the tree.

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=custom
CUSTOM_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/v1   # the base IN FULL, /v1 suffix included
CUSTOM_API_KEY=sk-whatever-your-vendor-issues   # optional — leave empty for a keyless endpoint
CUSTOM_MODEL=vendor-model-name
CUSTOM_CONTEXT_WINDOW=131072                 # the real window of that model
iva restart
```

The address convention is Ollama's: `https://ollama.com/v1`, not `https://ollama.com`. Iva appends `/chat/completions` and `/models` to what you wrote, so the `/v1`-style suffix belongs in the variable. `iva config` and the `/model` wizard both take it as text and refuse anything that is not a full `http(s)` address — a scheme-less `api.example.com/v1` would otherwise fail later as a fake network error.

Nothing about this endpoint is guessed. `CUSTOM_BASE_URL` and `CUSTOM_MODEL` have no defaults, and a blank one stops the agent at startup naming the variable — Iva will not borrow another provider's model or invent a host. `CUSTOM_API_KEY` is the exception: leave it empty and no `Authorization` header is sent at all, which is what a self-hosted server usually wants; `iva doctor` does not count it as missing.

Model selection follows whatever the endpoint offers. The wizard asks `GET {base}/models` first and shows the live list as buttons; endpoints that don't implement it (the OpenAI-compatible contract doesn't require it) fall through to typing the model id yourself, and that id is accepted as-is. A `401`/`403` is still a refusal — a wrong key does not become a "typed id".

Two deliberate omissions. `THINKING_EFFORT` is not sent to `custom`: `reasoning_effort` is not part of what OpenAI compatibility guarantees, and a blind extra field risks an HTTP 400 on every turn — pick `ollama`, `opencode` or `codex` if you want adjustable thinking. And the outbound security gate has no pattern for `CUSTOM_API_KEY`'s shape, because an arbitrary vendor's key has none; it is redacted by its name like every other prefixless key ([security.md](security.md)).

A local example, keyless:

```bash
MODEL_PROVIDER=custom
CUSTOM_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1
CUSTOM_API_KEY=
CUSTOM_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-32B-Instruct
CUSTOM_CONTEXT_WINDOW=32768
```

## Vision

Attachments are never inlined into the model request. A photo lands in the vault, the agent gets its file path, and the provider's own vision model writes the description — OCR plus visual detail — into the daily transcript. Same key as the text model, no extra subscription. Each provider's default is a `*_VISION_MODEL` line in `.env` and a step in `iva config`; `custom` has no default there, so an endpoint whose chat model reads images needs nothing, and one whose model doesn't needs a `CUSTOM_VISION_MODEL` and a `CUSTOM_API_KEY` to call it with. Being on a provider's model list is not the same as reading images: on Go the default is `qwen3.7-plus`, and several of the larger models there refuse a picture outright.

## VPS sizing

Any Ubuntu/Debian box for $4–5/mo. 512MB RAM works — the installer handles low-memory boxes ([install.md](install.md)). More than 1–2GB buys you little: the model runs in the cloud, not on your box.

## Voice — Deepgram

Transcription runs on Deepgram `nova-3` with `language=multi`: Russian, Uzbek and English are detected automatically, even mixed inside one voice note. A new account comes with a free starter credit — no card — that covers months of personal use. The one hard limit is Telegram's, not Deepgram's: the Bot API refuses downloads over 20MB, so a long video won't transcribe.

## Web search

| Provider                 | Free tier          | Card         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| **tavily** (recommended) | ~1,000 searches/mo | not required |
| **exa**                  | ~20,000/mo         | not required |
| **parallel**             | starter credits    | not required |
| **brave**                | ~$5/mo credit      | required     |

Pick one, set `SEARCH_PROVIDER` and its key. No key means no web search — Iva says so instead of guessing. DuckDuckGo scraping was removed on purpose: server IPs get captchas, and a search tool that randomly hits a wall is worse than none.

Optional hybrid memory search adds one more key (Jina or DeepInfra embeddings) — covered in [memory.md](memory.md).

## Total cost

| Service             | Monthly             |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| VPS                 | $4–5                |
| OpenCode Go         | ~$5                 |
| Deepgram voice      | $0 — starter credit |
| Web search (tavily) | $0 — free tier      |
| **Total**           | **~$9/mo**          |

Prefer Ollama Cloud and the same stack lands around $25/mo. Either way the bill is flat, predictable, and paid straight to the providers.
