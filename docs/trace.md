# Trace — the turn journal

The core writes one JSONL line per event: from the update the Bridge accepts to the answer
Outbox delivers. Two readers consume it — the `trace` plugin viewer and `iva trace` — so
this file, not the code, is the contract (ADR-0010). Terms follow `CONTEXT.md`.

File: `data/trace/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` under the data directory (`ASSISTANT_DATA_DIR`,
`./data` by default). Two processes append to it: the agent and the Bridge. Append-only,
one line per write.

## Event schema

Exactly seven fields, always in this order:

| Field     | Meaning                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ts`      | ISO-8601 **UTC**, the moment of writing                                            |
| `turn`    | turn key — three cases, see below                                                  |
| `session` | Eve session id (empty until the turn starts)                                       |
| `source`  | `telegram`, `bridge`, `web`, `http`, `rollup`, `watch`, `brief`, `cron`, `unknown` |
| `kind`    | group: `bridge`, `inbound`, `gate`, `context`, `turn`, `eve`, `outbox`, `stop`     |
| `name`    | the specific event inside the group                                                |
| `data`    | object: names, timings, sizes, content                                             |

`source` is `unknown` when an Eve event arrives without a channel kind. Journals of 0.4.11
and earlier may also carry `digest`. Note that `ts` is
UTC while the **day file** is named after the installation timezone
(`ASSISTANT_TIMEZONE`): near midnight the first lines of a file can carry a UTC timestamp
that belongs to the previous UTC day. That is deliberate — the journal splits days the way
the vault does.

A line is never longer than 16 KB **in UTF-8 bytes**. An event that does not fit loses its
content and is marked `data.traceTrimmed: true`; names, timings and sizes always survive.

## The three key spaces of `turn`

1. **Before the turn exists** — the update key `tg:<chatId>:<messageId>`. Both the Bridge
   and the core can compute it; `update_id` is invisible to the core.
2. **After the turn starts** — the Eve `turnId` (`turn_0`, `turn_1`, …). Subagent steps
   carry a suffix: `turn_3#planner`, the same key `data/usage.jsonl` uses.
3. **Night turns have no turn key at all.** Rollup and other cron deliveries go through
   the Eve client, which exposes only a session id, so their `gate.outbound` and
   `outbox.*` lines carry `turn: ""` with a non-empty `session` and `source` in
   {`rollup`, `cron`}. Watch and Brief parts are sent by the proactive tick itself: their
   lines carry `turn: ""`, no `session` and `source` `watch` or `brief`. The Eve events of
   that same night turn still carry `turn_N` from the hook, because the hook runs inside
   the agent.

**How a reader stitches one turn**

- _Chat turn:_ take `turn.bound`, collect everything whose `turn` equals its
  `data.updateKey` (Bridge, inbound, inbound gate) plus everything whose `turn` equals its
  `turn` (Eve events, Outbox, Stop), then sort by `ts`.
- _Night turn:_ group by `session` **and** `turn_N` together. One Eve session holds many
  turns — the nightly Rollup, for one, keeps its
  session alive across nights — so a session on its own would glue a fortnight of nights
  into one turn.
- _A line with no turn key_ (`gate.outbound` and `outbox.*` of a night send) belongs to the
  **most recent turn of its session** by `ts`.
- _Source is part of no key._ Inside one night turn the Eve lines carry
  `source: "unknown"` while `gate.outbound` and `outbox.*` carry `rollup`, so grouping by
  source would cut one turn in two.

Callback updates (`⏹ Stop`, `/menu` buttons) get the key `tg:<chatId>:cb:<callbackId>`,
and **only the Bridge produces it**: callbacks never reach `runTelegramInbound`, so those
`bridge.*` lines stay orphans with no `turn.bound` and no `inbound.*`.

Any Eve event may also carry `sessionId` in `data` (whenever its payload has one) and
`input` in content (with `inputChars`); the hook copies both by name.

**`gate.outbound` can appear without a matching `outbox.*`.** Every service reply the
channel sends (a working-status message, an error explanation, a media notice) passes the
same outbound gate but not the Outbox seam, so it produces a gate line alone. Do not wait
for a delivery event after each gate verdict.

Writer markers in `data`: `traceTrimmed` — the event went without content;
`traceUnreadable` — the payload could not be serialized. Markers inside values:
`…[truncated]` — a string or list was cut, `…[deep]` — nesting deeper than four levels,
`…[keys]` — how many fields the truncated object had, `…[unreadable]` — a field could not
be read.

### What is not in the journal

- **Delta events** (`message.appended`, `reasoning.appended`, `action.partial`). They
  repeat the accumulated text hundreds of times per turn; the final text arrives in
  `*.completed`.
- **Eve's own context composition.** CORE, PERSONA and the current time are injected by
  Eve's dynamic instructions, which cannot report from inside. `context.parts` gives the
  **size of those same files on disk** when the turn starts — an approximation, which the
  event itself states with `approximate: true`.
- **Gate verdicts outside a turn.** The sanitizer is called by scripts and unit tests too;
  without a turn key a verdict has nothing to attach to, so those calls write nothing.
  The in-process turn mark also expires after 60 seconds: if media handling of one inbound
  message takes longer than a minute, the gate verdict that follows it is not journaled.

## Content: the toggle and the caps

`data/settings.json`, field `captureContent` (on by default):

```json
{ "captureContent": false }
```

Turned off it keeps names, timings and sizes — the turn stays fully visible, only without
text. Every content field is capped at 2000 characters with the `…[truncated]` marker.

Sizes are written for **string** content fields only, as `<key>Chars` (`text` →
`textChars`). Array content — `args[]`, `context[]` — gets no size; their counts already
live in `data` as `actions[]` and `parts`.

## Retention

14 days: today's file and the 13 before it. Pruning goes by the **date in the file name**,
never by mtime (ADR-0002: file time lies after a copy or a restore), and runs on the first
journal write of a process and again whenever the day file changes. Files whose names do
not match `YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` are left alone.

## Guarantees for a reader

- Every line is standalone valid JSON; one broken line does not spoil its neighbours.
- A write failure never breaks or slows a turn: it goes to the service log (at most once a
  minute) and nothing else.
- Two processes append to one file, so line order is write order, not turn order. Sort by
  `ts`.
