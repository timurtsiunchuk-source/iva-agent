// Server-start hook (eve auto-discovers this file and runs it before any agent code).
// Two jobs, both side effects, no telemetry actually configured here:
//
//   1. TZ fallback so the process' local time (used by cron-parsed schedules below, which
//      fire in the process's OWN local time — eve schedules carry no timezone of their
//      own) matches ASSISTANT_TIMEZONE instead of defaulting to the host's system TZ.
//   2. fire-and-forget the systemd → eve-schedules migration (retire the old memory-rollup
//      timers, catch up a missed period). This is the one reliable point in the codebase
//      that always runs on the NEW server, even right after an `iva update` executed by
//      the OLD CLI process (started through the permanent bin/iva.mjs shim) doesn't
//      know about eve schedules at all.
//
// setup() runs before eve's own HTTP listener is guaranteed to be accepting connections.
// A catch-up run spawns scripts/memory/night.ts, which calls the configured model
// against that same listener immediately — spawning it too early is a bare "connection
// refused", not a retryable rollup failure. So the migration itself is only kicked off
// after polling the local health route (the same probeEveHealth used by `iva update`'s
// post-restart check) confirms the listener is actually up, bounded to ~2 minutes; if it
// never comes up in time, this boot's catch-up is skipped (logged) rather than run
// blind — the next boot's migration retries it exactly as it would any other stale period.
//
// recordInputs/recordOutputs: false — this file's mere presence implicitly enables eve's
// authored-telemetry path (see eve/docs/guides/instrumentation.md) and disables the
// zero-config local dev tracer; since no OTel exporter is registered below, telemetry is
// otherwise inert, but a stray default of `true` would still turn on payload capture we
// never asked for. Keep `eve dev` startup unaffected — verified by `timeout 30 npx eve dev`.
