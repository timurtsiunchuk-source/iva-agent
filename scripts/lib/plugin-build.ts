 * The code of a plugin inside the build of a version (ADR-0009).

 * built is a version build: copy the plugin into the version, install its production
 * dependencies, build the extension with the version's own eve, and generate the mount
 * that makes eve pick it up. Nothing here starts, flips or restarts anything - the rails
 * are the updater's (scripts/lib/version-update.ts), so a plugin arrives the same way a
 * release does: build, probe, flip, restart.
 *
 * The plugin store lives in the authored tree, which `iva` and the updater's second half
 * must load without (ADR-0003, scripts/authored-tree-guard.test.ts). Everything from
 * `agent/` is therefore reached through `tryLoadPluginCore()`, and a missing tree is a
 * diagnostic, not a crash: a version that cannot read its plugins still builds.
